Quiel's Todo-list-2

Description: 
My second attempt at creating a To-Do List application using JavaScript ES6. The app is designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface to add, edit, and delete tasks.

Key Features:
1) Adding Tasks: You can add new tasks to your to-do list by entering the task description in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
2) Edit and Update: If you need to modify a task, simply click on the pencil icon next to the task, make your changes, and save it.
3) Check Tasks: To mark a task as completed, click on the checkbox icon next to the task. You can also uncheck it if needed.
4) Delete Tasks: If you want to remove a task from your list, click on the trash can icon, and it will be deleted.
5) Color Coding: Each task is assigned a random color, making it visually distinct in the list.
6) Local Storage: Your to-do list is saved in your browser's local storage, ensuring your tasks are retained even if you close or refresh the page.

Getting Started:
To get started with this app, simply open the HTML file in your web browser. You can add, edit, and manage your tasks right in the browser.
